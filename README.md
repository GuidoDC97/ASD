# Algorithms and Data Structure
 Repository for Algorithms and Data Structure project.
 
 Individual project about performance analysis of main comparison sorting algorithms.
 
 ## Solution
 Implementation in C of algorithms can be found in folder **[Workspace Eclipse](/Workspace%20Eclipse)**.
 Analysis on collected performance data have been carried out in python using JupyterNotebook as IDE.
 
 Detailed description about the approach taken, the algorithms complexity, the pseudocodes and final conclusions are provided in **[Elaborato ASD.html](/Elaborato%20ASD.html)**.
